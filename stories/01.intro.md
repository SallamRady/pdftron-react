1.  installation package::npm i @pdftron/webviewer
2.  Next we must copy the static assets required for WebViewer to run. The files are located in `node_modules/@pdftron/webviewer/public` and must be moved into a location that will be served and publicly accessible. In React, it will be `public` folder.
